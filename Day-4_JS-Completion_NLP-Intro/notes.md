### Day 4 — JavaScript Completion + NLP Intro

*Status:* Focused on completing JavaScript basics and exploring NLP for backend logic.

*What I learned:*
- Completed *JavaScript fundamentals*:
  - Functions, loops, arrays, conditionals, and events.
  - Understood how JS connects front-end interactions with logic.
- Began learning *NLP (Natural Language Processing)* concepts for Expo app backend:
  - What NLP is and how it can be used to process text input.
  - Basic pipeline idea — tokenization, stemming, intent recognition.

*Reflection:*
I now feel comfortable with JavaScript syntax and how it supports dynamic app behavior.  
Exploring NLP broadened my understanding of backend intelligence for our project.

*Next Steps:*
- Practice small JavaScript mini-projects.
- Research practical NLP APIs (like Hugging Face or OpenAI) to connect later with the Expo app.
