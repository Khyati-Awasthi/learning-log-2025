# Day 1 â€” HTML, CSS & Tailwind Basics
*Date:* Oct 6, 2025

## What I learned
- Basic HTML structure (doctype, head, body)
- CSS selectors, box model, layout basics
- Tailwind setup (CDN) and useful classes (flex, grid, spacing, colors)

## Key takeaways
- Utility-first styling speeds up prototypes.
- Keep notes and screenshots for every small change.

## Next steps
- Tomorrow: add the Amazon Clone folder and apply Tailwind to style it.
