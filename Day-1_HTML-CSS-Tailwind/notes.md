# Day 1 — HTML, CSS & Tailwind Basics
*Date:* Oct 6, 2025

## What I learned
- Basic HTML structure (doctype, head, body)
- CSS selectors, box model, layout basics
- Tailwind setup (CDN) and useful classes (flex, grid, spacing, colors)

## Key takeaways
- Utility-first styling speeds up prototypes.
- Keep notes and screenshots for every small change.

## Next steps
- Tomorrow: add the Amazon Clone folder and apply Tailwind to style it.

### *Day 2 – Amazon Clone (In Progress)*  
*Date:* October 7, 2025
*Project:* Amazon Clone (Frontend)  
*Tech Stack:* HTML, CSS, Flexbox  

*What I worked on today:*  
- Continued developing the Amazon Clone UI using semantic HTML and modular CSS.  
- Structured the homepage layout, including the header, navigation bar, hero section, and initial product grid.  
- Implemented Flexbox for responsive alignment and consistent spacing across sections.  
- Iterated on layout debugging to fix container width inconsistencies.  

*Key learnings:*  
- Improved understanding of *Flexbox properties* for building adaptive layouts.  
- Learned to maintain *clean, reusable CSS classes* for large-scale pages.  
- Gained insight into how e-commerce layouts handle complex multi-section structures.  

*Challenges faced:*  
- Minor issues with alignment and element overflow in the product grid.  
- Need to refine spacing consistency between sections.  

*Next steps:*  
- Complete the footer and remaining homepage elements.  
- Add hover states and transition effects for interactive UI feedback.  
- Begin optimizing CSS structure and preparing the README.md file for project documentation.  

*Reflection:*  
Progressed on the foundational layout and responsive structure of the Amazon Clone. Focused on writing cleaner, modular code and understanding how professional front-end workflows scale for complex websites.

### Day-3 Tailwind Theory + JavaScript Start(No Laptop)

*Date:* October 8, 2025

**Status:** Couldn't code today due to unavailbility of laptop but continued learning theoretical resources from mobile phone

**What I learned:**
-Completed theoretical understanding of **Tailwind CSS**:
-Utility-first approach.
-Responsive breakpoints and modifiers.
-How classes combine to create layouts quickly.
-Started learning **JavaScript basics** through YouTube (variables,data types,console output and DOM intro).

**Reflection:**
Even without coding hands-on,I now understand how Tailwind streamlines design work nad why JavaScipt is essential for interactivity.

**Next Steps:**
- Apply Tailwind practicallywhen back on laptop
- Continue JavaScript fundamentals(functions,arrays,loops)
